# Playing around with Rust

Decided to follow a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnT_7M7L7vo) making a simple snake game in Rust. This was our mobile gaming in 1997.

Reason? I've got a week off work and fancy learning some new tech :)

## Getting Started
* [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* Clone this repo
* cd into where the code is
* cargo run
